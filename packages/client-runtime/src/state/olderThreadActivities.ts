 *
 * One implementation holds all the hardening the per-client copies kept

 * - reset on live-window RESHAPE, not just thread switch: a reconnect
 *   re-snapshot changes the window's chronological-oldest row and a checkpoint
 *   revert shrinks it, but a plain append does neither (the reducer re-sorts
 *   unsequenced rows, so index 0 is not a stable boundary — the sentinel is
 *   {@link liveWindowOldestActivityId});
 * - a generation guard so a load resolving after a reset can't repopulate the
 *   cleared state;
 * - a synchronous in-flight key so scroll-triggered duplicate dispatches
 *   coalesce before the loading state commits;
 * - an explicit advancing cursor (the oldest row paged PAST), so an
 *   all-overlap page keeps paging instead of dead-ending while the server
 *   still reports more — the server cursor is strict, so it strictly
 *   decreases and paging cannot loop;
 * - dedup against the LATEST merged set via a ref, so a live append or a
 *   prior prepend settling mid-flight can't produce duplicate ids;
 * - `hasMore` stays true on a failed/skipped page (the history still exists;
 *   scrolling back retries).
